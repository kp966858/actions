# RING DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLE
# ====================================
# This workflow will deploy a new version of the application progressively to the production environments
#
# Current flow:
# ------------
# deploy shared db > approval > deploy shared webapi > deploy shared cdn > approval 
# > deploy AA db > deploy AA webapi # > deploy AA cdn  > approval > 
# > deploy BB db > deploy BB webapi # > deploy B cdn  >... > deploy cms
#
# We have approval after the Shared DB deploy, but not the others
# Everything else after Shared deployed ‚Äúin batch‚Äù for each app
# And Shared CMS as last thing
